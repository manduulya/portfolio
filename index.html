                <p>My name is Enkhmanlai Enkhbold. I would like to go with Ebo which is a nickname of my lastname. I am a normal guy but has a bigger 
                    heart than average people. I am a father of darling daughter and husband of beautiful wife. 
                    I started working on and with computers since when I was 5th grader. My family runs graphic designing, photographing,
                    framing, and printing business in Mongolia. So I know Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Lightroom etc. 
                    I've always wanted to be great graphic designer until I encountered coding and problem solving.
                    I loved problem solving and working in team. I realized how much pride I get after the team work and it's accomplishment.
                    I have consistently spent hours per everysingle day, learning new skills to get my new career started with Web development.
                    Therefore, I've learnt HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, JQuery, React JS, Node JS etc.
                    <br>Also, I really like to plan my life from days to years. It gives my confidence and self-organization to step forward.
                    I have so many hobbies from playing guitar, driving and working on cars, taking photos, hiking, video gaming, swimming,
                    listening music, and travelling. Sometimes I get tired but I just don't stop.
