              My name is Enkhmanlai Enkhbold. I would like to go with Ebo which
              is a nickname of my last name. I am a typical Mongolian guy but
              has a bigger heart. I am the father of the darling daughter and
              husband of a beautiful wife.
              <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I started working on computers since
              when I was 5th grader. My family runs graphic designing,
              photographing, framing, and printing business in Mongolia. So I
              know Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Lightroom, etc. I've always
              wanted to be a great graphic designer until I encountered coding
              and problem-solving. I loved problem-solving and working in a
              team. I realized how much pride I get after the teamwork and its
              accomplishment. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have consistently
              spent hours every single day, learning new skills to get my new
              career started with Web development. Therefore, I've built several
              projects using while learning HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery,
              React JS, Node JS, etc. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, I like
              to plan my life from days to years. It gives me confidence and
              self-organization to step forward. I have so many hobbies from
              playing guitar, driving and working on cars, taking photos,
              hiking, video gaming, swimming, listening to music, to traveling.
              Sometimes I get tired but I just don't stop.
